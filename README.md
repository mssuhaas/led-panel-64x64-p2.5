# Led-matrix-display

The LED Matrix is 64x64 RGB 2.5mm pitch which is interfaced by HUB75E connectors.
The display is controlled by a ESP32 dev module. The initial goal for this display was to show a notification to call people from one room to other and give warning incase any visitors are coming etc.

The ESP32 dev module is connected to the led display using HUB75E and buzzer when there is a notification.

(TODO)[add the connections to the HUB75E from ESP32 in form of a table]
